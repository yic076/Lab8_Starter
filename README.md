# Lab 8 - Starter Worked Alone
1. I would fit automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Because we need to know quickly whether the new code or changes we made functions or not. It's best to find a bug and solve it when it's just created. Therefore, option 3 doesn't make sense. And option 2 also feels wrong since manually running all tests looses the point of having tests done automatically.    
2. No. Checking if a function is returning the correct output shhould not be tested in a full End-to-end test. First, it takes too much time. Second, even if something unexpected happened, because we are doing an end-to-end test, we can't be certain that the issue stems from this particular function. Therefore, we should just use a unit-test(s).    
3. I would not, because the message feature seems like it will involve many parts of the application; mostly the sending to another user part. Sending a message to another user will proabbly use the network (and this process would also involve with functions responsible for finding the user, receiving the message, etc). It's not local anymore and I think it will be difficult for a unit-test to proof the validity of the feature.   
4. Yes, because max message length is completely local. And all it checks is whether a text (which can be thought of as just a string) exceeds a certain length. This is a simple enough task for a unit-test.
